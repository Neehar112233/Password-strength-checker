# Password Strength Checker

## 📌 Project Overview
The Password Strength Checker is a simple Python-based application that evaluates the strength of a user’s password based on commonly accepted security rules. It analyzes factors such as password length, character diversity, and complexity to classify passwords as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.  
This project helps promote secure password practices and demonstrates basic security validation logic.
